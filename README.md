I am Florent, born in the 2000s and grew up surrounded by technology. I am a Software Engineer at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) and a maintainer of the [Vitess project](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess).

I obtained my bachelor's degree of IT at [EPITECH](https://www.epitech.eu/en/) in 2020 and my master's degree of computer science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2022.
